# Android Barcode Scanner App
An Android application which uses the *zxing* library and the phone camera to scan barcodes of bills.
Upon a successful scan, it should copy the bill reference and put it inside your clipboard for easy use later, 
as well as insert a record of successful payment in the database.

This repository is only a part of a bigger system that I built for my bill paying needs.
